1) linear regression requires normal response of predictor variables  
2) logistic regression is not a regression (it's a pure, core example of regression in statistics! invented exactly for *this* very purpose)  
3) non-parametric tests like Mann-Whitney test the same hypothesis as the t-test  
4) Mann-Whitney and other rank-based tests compare medians (by no means, unless compared samples are all IID, which is less than unrealistic)  
5) N>30 is sufficient for the CLT to "do its job" (even 15k may be too few)  
6) normality tests confirm distribution normality (one doesn't prove H0)  
7) p-value is a probability of H0 (or H1)  
8) Testing hypotheses after transforming data with Box-Cox is about the same hypothesis (practically everything is changed, often ruined)  
9) CLT requires ID samples (which one? There are lots of them, some don't require it at all)  
10) ANOVA is a test / ANOVA is a model (neither. ANOVA uses tests for each main effect, ANOVA works on a TOP of a model)  
11) median difference = difference of medians  
12) median cannot be affected by hundreds just by a single observation  
13) statistical significance = practical importance  
14) Cohen D measures practical importance
